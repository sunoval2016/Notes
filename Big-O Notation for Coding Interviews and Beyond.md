## Basics

Integer array sorting with Bubble sort, Merge sort and Dual Pivot Quicksort (Java's util.Arrays.sort).

Generally speaking, time and space have an inversely proportionally relationship with each other; if space increases then execution time decreases, and if execution time increases then space decreases.

$f(n)$ belongs to the set $\Theta(g(n))$

​																	$$0\le c_1g(n) \le f(n) \le c_2g(n)$$

​																		$$f(n)=\Theta g(n)$$
