# Computer Vision - General Notes

[toc]

Algorithms, functions for computer vision, 3D vision, and video processing. Perform object detection and tracking, feature detection, extraction, and matching. For 3D vision includes single, stereo, and fisheye camera calibration; stereo vision; 3D reconstruction; and lidar and 3D point cloud processing.

Object detectors using deep learning and machine learning algorithms, such as YOLO v2, Faster R-CNN, and ACF. For sematic segmentation using deep learning algorithms such as SegNet, U-Net, and DeepLab.

Accelerate algorithms by running on multicore processors and GPUs.

## Feature Detection and Extraction

## Deep Learning, Sematic Segmentation and Detection

## Camera Calibration and 3-D Vision

Estimate camera intrinsics, distortion coefficients, and camera extrinsics, extract 3-D information from 2-D images, perform stereo rectification, depth estimation, 3-D reconstruction, triangulation and structure from motion.
