## Intro to Algorithms

Algorithms put "science" into "computer science".

- Compression algorithms
- Route finding algorithms
- Rending algorithms
- Optimization & Scheduling algorithms
- Minimax algorithms

What makes a good algorithm?

1. Correctness
2. Efficiency

Perfect or good enough

Asymptotic analysis

*binary search* for sorted arrays

Route-finding: Start on the goal, keep marking squares in the maze in order of increasing distance from the goal (k->k+1). The program then find a path to the goal by choosing path of decreasing, like going downhill.
